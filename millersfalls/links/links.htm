<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
<p><img src="linkopener.jpg" alt="J. Gibson boxwood plow plane" width="300" height="241" class="floatright">The world of antique tool collecting is a fascinating indeed. These links will direct you to some of the best sites on the web. While many collectors also use their tools for work or pleasure, those  claiming to be interested only in the use of vintage tools are often closet collectors. If you choose to pursue an interest in old tools, please be kind. More antique tools are destroyed by misguided restoration attempts than by neglect.</p>
