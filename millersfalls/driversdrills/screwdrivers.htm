  <p>Much of this listing has been developed from information found in Millers
    Falls catalogs. The features listed for each tool may differ from actual
    examples. While the company typically stressed new features in its catalogs,
    it seldom mentioned the disappearance of a feature or a feature that had
    become so commonly accepted that it was no longer noteworthy. Then too,
    production practices varied from catalog copy and illustrations were slow
    to be updated. By 1960, catalog copy had become so vague that a detailed
    description of features is not possible.</p>

    <p>These screwdrivers are throwbacks to an earlier time in that the automatic spiral feature drives screws only. In order to withdraw screws, the tools must be locked and rotated counterclockwise by a worker turning his wrist. Millers Falls marketed these screwdrivers to manufacturers who needed to drive screws during an assembly process and seldom withdrew them. Of simpler construction than double spiral models, these screwdrivers enjoyed a longer life span.</p>
    <p>Identical to Nos. 510, 520 and 570 but lacks automatic return. The company manufactured and sold separately a ball-type auxiliary chuck that allowed the use of dimpled drill points.</p>

    <p>Spring in stained hardwood handle allows for automatic return; single spiral drives screws only; spiral design locks and turns to the right; ratchet adjusted by knurled control sleeve and  nut for locking spiral; spiral runs in  two bronze nuts; quick release chuck; exposed parts nickel plated; shipped with three screwdriver bits.</p>
    <p>These screwdrivers are throwbacks to an earlier time in that the automatic spiral feature drives screws only. In order to withdraw screws, the tools must be locked and rotated counterclockwise by a worker turning his wrist. Millers Falls marketed these screwdrivers to manufacturers who needed to drive screws during an assembly process and seldom withdrew them. Of simpler construction than double spiral models, these screwdrivers enjoyed a longer life span.</p>
    <p>Identical to Nos. 51, 52 and 57 save for automatic return.  The company manufactured and sold separately a ball-type auxiliary chuck that allowed the use of dimpled drill points.</p>
