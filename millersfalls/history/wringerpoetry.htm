On July 31, 1865, Gunn, Amidon &amp; Co. placed these verses in the Greenfield <cite>Gazette and Courier</cite>. The poem concerns itself with the improved clothes wringer patented by Charles H. Amidon that spring. While not exactly a literary masterpiece, a close examination will show that, except for subtlety, there is little new in the psychology of advertising. Amidon&rsquo;s improved wringer was chain-driven and avoided the use of cogs for powering the upper roller.  



<h2>The Best Clothes Wringer</h2>

<p>Lady, fair lady, O pray have you seen
<br>
Gunn, Amidon Co.'s Wringing Machine?
<br>For beauty, utility, elegance, blend
<br>In this gem of perfection your helper and friend.</p>

<p>Mechanics have striven again and again,
<br>To lessen the care and the labors of men,
<br>But this firm, enterprising, their genius gave,
<br>Your labors to lighten, your beauty to save.</p>

<p>Pray madam, just try it, and then while you wring,
<br>Its excellent character truly I&rsquo;ll sing,
<br>Or rather young hopeful, (just five did you say),
<br>Let the little chap turn it for pastime and play.</p>

<p>Observe ma'am its action&#8212;fine sport for the boy,
<br>Yet your labors accomplished, your clothes are all dry,
<br>
Now wringing's a pastime, no longer a bore,
<br>Your delicate fingers to blister and sore.</p>

<p>Just as good for a life-time as you see it to-day,
<br>For rubber wears slowly, and now let me say
<br>That this cunning contrivance, this wonderful chain,
<br>The choicest production of Amidon&rsquo;s brain,</p>

<p>Keeps the roller together, prevents any stress
<br>When you wring out your laces, your quilts, or your dress;
<br>
Madam pray buy it&#8212;the blessing you&rsquo;ll prize,
<br>As the joy of your life, and the light of your eyes.</p>

<p>The rich and the poor, may every one try it,
<br>For the pitiful sum of eight-fifty will buy it,
<br>When you&rsquo;ve used it yourself for many long years,
<br>You can leave it your daughters, the charming young dears.</p>

<p>On washing-day then they never will scold,
<br>And they&rsquo;ll cherish this treasure more precious than gold,
<br>It&rsquo;s better than potions for comfort or health,
<br>A household divinity, saver of wealth.</p>

<p>You know very well your clothes when you twist,
<br>At the peril of every strained cord in your wrist,
<br>That your muslins are ruined, why now ain&rsquo;t it clear,
<br>That the jewel will pay for itself in a year.</p>

<p>You may travel the land from the East to the West,
<br>And of wringers you&rsquo;ll find that this gem is the best;
<br>No useless incumbrance [sic], simplicity clogs,
<br>No hard-working, useless, unsightly old cogs.</p>

<p>They are quite superseded, extinguished &rsquo;tis plain,
<br>By Amidon&rsquo;s patent and wonderful chain;
<br>Simple, unique, most efficient it stands,
<br>The pride of America,&#8212;noblest of lands.</p>

<p>Husbands who love and who cherish their wives,
<br>A wringer will lengthen, and sweeten their lives;
<br>Father who wish for your daughter&rsquo;s affection,
<br>Of presents this is just the nicest selection.</p>

<p>To your cousin, connection, relation or friend,
<br>Nothing more potent on earth can you send,
<br>To win you their gratitude, love and esteem,
<br>Than the wringer I&rsquo;m singing, the poet&rsquo;s best theme.</p>
