    <li>Telephone interview, Edward Shortell Jr., January 5, 2005. Edward Shortell, Jr. is the son of Edward Shortell, the superintendent of the factory located in Miller Falls in the early 1950s and later general superintendent for both the Millers Falls and Greenfield plants. The elder Shortell considered the incident to be a significant factor in the company’s inability to compete with the likes of Black and Decker. John J. Owen, the nephew of Philip Rogers, part of the 1950s management team and Millers Falls Company president from 1962-1965, confirmed the incident and added the information about passing on wartime incentives. Telephone interview, John Owen, March 5, 2005.</li>
