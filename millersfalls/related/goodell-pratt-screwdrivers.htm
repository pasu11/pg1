  <p>This listing has been developed from information found in Goodell Brothers and Goodell-Pratt Company catalogs. The features listed for each drill may differ from actual examples. While the company typically stressed new features in its catalogs, it seldom mentioned the disappearance of a feature or the addition of a feature that had become so commonly accepted that it was no longer noteworthy. Then too, production practices varied from catalog copy and illustrations
    were slow to be updated. </p>
