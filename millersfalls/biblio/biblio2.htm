    <li>63 pages  ; 12 x 18 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although Edward Markham compiled this collection of formulae, facts and recipes for the &quot;mechanic,&quot; much of the information would prove helpful to a carpenter. Among the interesting recipes&#8212;bluing, browning, and artificial case hardening for steel. Contains fourteen pages on boring tools and hacksaw frames which serve as a thinly-disguised promotion for Millers Falls tools.</p>

    <li>16 pages ; 14 x 9 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Title from cover. Published just a few months before the new catalog no. 36, this pamphlet was sized for easy insertion into the small format <cite>Catalog K</cite>. Although the company did not sell to retail customers, it anticipated  many would see the list and warned, &quot;This price list is published for the sake of telling the buyer the cost at his local dealer's store (always plus transportation charges) and is not intended as an invitation to dealings direct with factory.&quot;</p>
  <p>Shown as an example of price lists produced at the time. Other dates and versions exist.</p>

    <li>219 pages  ; 16 x 24 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Large format</strong> catalog. Contains an illustration of the No. 144 double action boring machine, perhaps the strangest boring tool that the company ever marketed. The double action boring machine was out of production by 1929. The catalog also announces the acquisition of the Ford Auger Bit Company. Prior to this time, the company sold augers for its boring machines only. With the purchase of the new company, Millers Falls began to carry a full line of auger bits.</p>

    <li>219 pages  ; 10 x 14 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Pocket-size</strong> catalog.  Not all versions for small format <cite>Catalog no. L</cite> are identical. Though all issues examined to to date contain 219 numbered pages, the contents are not always identical. This is most notable with the later versions of <cite>Catalog no. L</cite> where some of the breast drills were eliminated. The small format <cite>Catalog no. L</cite> remained in use until 1921&#8212;well after the publication of large format <cite>Catalogue No. 37</cite> in 1919.</p>

    <li>West Haven, Conn.: West Haven Mfg., 1918.</li>
    <li>52 pages  ; 10 x 14.5 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Title from cover. Issued two years before West Haven Mfg. Co. was purchased by Millers Falls, this catalog gives a good idea of the West Haven product line prior to the buyout. Cut off from its source of hacksaw blades after its decades-old relationship with Clemson Brothers soured, Millers Falls was interested in secure access to a product that formed a sizable and quite  profitable  part of its operation. Although not all of the West Haven products made the transition to the Millers Falls lineup, the acquisition also brought punches, nail sets, several hacksaw frames and turned steel plumb bobs to the lineup. Includes an illustration of the West Haven plant and an illustration of female workers inspecting hack saw blades. </p>

    <li>217 pages  ; 16 x 24 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Large format</strong> catalog.  A reminder of the the Millers Falls Company's presence in Europe, the catalog pictured here was once the property of the Cruz &amp; Pereira of Lisbon, Portugal. <cite>Catalogue no. 37</cite> is unusual in that  no corresponding small format catalog was issued. Rather than publishing a <cite>Catalog no. M</cite>, the company simply re-issued <cite>Catalog no. L</cite> with slight changes to its content. Among the changes since 1917, several braces and breast drills were dropped.</p>

  <h2>1920</h2>
  <a href="biblioimg/1920-catalog-l-lg.jpg"><img src="biblioimg/1920-catalog-l.jpg" alt="Millers Falls Company catalog L, variant" width="130" height="190" class="floatleftlink"></a>
  <ul class="nodot">
    <li>Millers Falls Company.</li>
    <li><cite>Catalog No. L.</cite></li>
    <li>Millers Falls, Mass. : Millers Falls Co., September 1, 1917 [altered 1920].</li>
    <li>219 pages  ; 10 x 14 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Variant pocket-size</strong> catalog.  The Millers Falls Company was faced with an identity problem when Clemson Brothers abruptly ended a long-standing agreement to supply the company with its Star brand hacksaw blades. Millers Falls had been selling the Star blades for almost forty years. It had adopted the Star name for its drill chucks and had even gone so far as to have incorporated a star into the company trademark. Rather than incur the expense of reprinting its catalogs after the termination of the agreement, Millers Falls pasted a red dot over the star on the covers, and the pages containing listings for Star hacksaw blades were overstamped with the word &quot;discontinued.&quot;</p>
  <div class="spacer"><br>
  </div>
  <h2>1921</h2>
  <a href="biblioimg/1921-catalog-l-lg.jpg"><img src="biblioimg/1921-catalog-l.jpg" alt="Millers Falls Company catalog L, variant" width="130" height="192" class="floatleftlink"></a>

    <li>219 pages  ; 10 x 14 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Variant pocket-size</strong> catalog.  The first use of the Millers Falls Company's red-triangle trademark occurred in 1921. In that year, the company pasted an image of its new logo over the red star trademark on the covers of the last of its 1917 catalogs and distributed them. The change was necessary because Clemson Brothers had ended a long-standing agreement to supply the company with its Star brand hacksaw blades. The pages containing listings for Star hacksaw blades are overstamped with the word &quot;discontinued.&quot;</p>

    <li>215 pages, [4] leaves of plates  ; 19 x 27 cm.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Large format</strong> catalog. Introduces the iconic trademark which features a triangle inscribed with the words &quot;since 1868&quot; located under the Millers Falls Tools trapezoid. The company added punches and nail sets to its product lineup as a result of its acquiring complete control of the West Haven Manufacturing Company, a well-established manufacturer of small tools. With the purchase of West Haven, the Millers Falls Company became a manufacturer,
    rather than a distributor of hack saw blades. Includes four unnumbered colored plates--one of which can be seen at right.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Title from cover. A counter-top promotion printed on both sides, folded twice to form a booklet. With the purchase of the National Machine Company in 1920, the company began to add  automotive tools to its lineup. Though it marketed automobile and truck jacks, rim wrenches, valve grinders, screwdrivers and bearing scrapers, the company never positioned itself to be a  major supplier of tools for the automotive mechanic.  The inside of of the brochure depicts a fourteen-year-old girl raising a large automobile with a Millers falls jack. Oddly, the copywriter is sure to point out that, &quot;The girl in the picture is a real girl, sketched from life, in the act of lifting one end of a heavy touring car ...&quot; Beneath the photo is a blank space for a hardware dealer's stamp.</p>

  <p>Title from cover. A  counter-top promotion printed on both sides, folded twice to form a booklet. Provides catalog-type information for hand and power hacksaw blades. The blades included represent a subset of those found in the company's catalog. The use of elfin creatures to promote tools was not unique to the Millers Falls company. The Stanley Rule and Level Company had used an imp as early as 1888, and the Goodell-Pratt Company created the gnome-like Mr. Punch. Includes an illustration of the Millers Falls Company's hacksaw blade plant in West Haven, Connecticut. The example reproduced here has been marked for distribution by R. H.

  <p>Title from cover. Date from printer's code on back. A  counter-top promotion printed on both sides, folded twice times to form a booklet. Features the company's Langdon, New Langdon and Millers Falls miter boxes. Unlike the Langdons, the Millers Falls boxes were inexpensive models, designed for the budget conscious or for use in situations where cast iron miter boxes were not practical or might be easily damaged. The light-weight  No. 41, a tool capable of making compound cuts, is promoted as especially useful for sawing cornice moldings at the top of a ladder. Considering  the device's saw guide accommodated both panel and back saws, the No. 41 provided a lot of functionality for a modest price. Beneath the brochure's cover photo is a blank space for a hardware dealer's stamp. </p>

  <p>Title from cover.  With too too many pages to be considered a  counter-top promotion, this trade circular is a pocket-sized booklet.  Features the new line of bench and block planes planes that the company rolled out in 1929. Rather than introducing several planes and gradually expanding production, forty-six numbers&#8212;twenty-one of them block planes&#8212;were simultaneously brought to market. Unusual for one of the company's trade circulars in that it is a thirteen-page pamphlet rather than a brochure created from a single folded sheet.
