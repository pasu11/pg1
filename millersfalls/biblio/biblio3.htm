  </ul>
  <p><strong>Small format</strong> catalog and easily missed<strong> variant</strong> of <cite>70th Anniversary Catalog No. 42</cite>. Despite the 1938 date on the introductory page, this catalog was published in 1940. A 'new tool' section, consisting of 16 pages lettered A-P, appears to the front of the catalog and documents the appearance of the company's No. 206 block plane and the No. 70 hand drill. Although the title page indicates  this is the 70th anniversary catalog, the ubiquitous 70th Anniversary graphic seen on almost every page of earlier versions of catalog no. 42 is absent. </p>
  <p>There is no use of red ink, and the dimensions of the catalog are noticeably smaller than those of the 1939 small format edition. Introductory page for scraper section is shown at right.</p>
