  <p>Folded accordion style to create a document with two covers&#8212;one side contains an illustration and information for the Lester Improved Saw; the other side does the same for the New Rogers Saw. Published between the time of the introduction of New Rogers Saw in 1879 and the demise of the Boston office in about 1880. Royal C. Graves, the manager of the Boston office, wrote to the office at the Millers Falls plant about having  some scroll saw circulars printed during the summer of 1879.

  </ul>
  <p>Title from cover. The example seen here has had some water damage. The cover was virtually identical to the 1884 catalog save that it was a very dark brown rather than the red-brown of the 1884 publication. This is the catalog that introduced 
    Wallace Lyon's patented brace drill to the public. It is also the catalog carrying an announcement that the firm  would no longer be supplying customers with the original Barber Brace since it considered the Barber Improved Brace to be a superior tool. The move proved premature, for within a short time, the firm was once again offering Barber Braces.</p>

The only catalog located to date that illustrates the company's &quot;walking beam&quot; scroll saw, a treadle tool featuring &quot;a solid iron frame, rather than wooden arms, as the saw runs in guides.&quot; The illustration block used to produce the illustration of the Rogers miter planer on page 53 must have presented a puzzle for  the printer. Tool is depicted upside down.  Includes such unexpected items as Goddard's patented meat and vegetable chopper and Kohn's trace holder, a pin designed to be driven into a whiffletree.</p>

After the Greenfield Tool Company folded, the Millers Falls Company acquired the rights  the  Colburn and  Parker patents for the dies used in forging ox shoes  and  it marketed its output as the <em>Greenfield Forged Ox Shoe</em>. The Parker patent had originally been awarded to Bowdoin S. Parker,  the nephew of the company's treasurer, <a href="../biography/gunn.htm">Levi J. Gunn</a>. This brochure was apparently directed to the blacksmith trade. In addition to the ox-shoes, it features heavy-duty metallic vises and the sort of jack screws handy for making wagon repairs.</p>

  <p>The image of the cover seen here is courtesy of the Museum of Our Industrial Heritage in Greenfield, Massachusetts. It is  atypical of a nineteenth century catalog in  that it is hardbound. The bit braces, hand drills and breast drills depicted in this issue often bear little resemblance to the actual products. The situation improved with the next catalog as this was the last issue to include illustrations  of the firm's bit braces printed from blocks that were cut in  the early 1870s.</p>

  <p>The introduction to the catalog makes much of &quot;Star&rdquo; brand saws and saw blades. The company served as the sole sales agent for the Star brand blades, a relationship which lasted for decades. The introduction also stresses improvements to the Millers Falls Company's hand and breast drills (three-jaw chucks for the eggbeaters, new alligator jaws for the breast drills). The cover the original was extremely worn and low contrast. </p>
